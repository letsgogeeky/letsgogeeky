## Hello, This is Ramy

I'm a senior software engineer @ IQVIA, I work on building software to ingest and analyze research datasets that later get used in clinical research.
I Studied Computer Science, and I'm currently also coding @ 42 Heilbronn.

I've used many tools and languages. I enjoy using many of them like Python, JS, Go, GCP, NGINX, PostgreSQL, Sentry, Git, Docker, Django, Flask, ReactJs, and Ansible. However, I use the tool that fits the solution/requirements regardless of how much I like/dislike it.
<!---
### My GitHub says I write those languages, but I can argue that I can write other languages as well:
